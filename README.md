# Crime Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project applies machine learning models to predict crime patterns based on a public dataset.

## Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle Crime Dataset](link)
- Features include location, type of crime, date/time, etc.

## Methods
- Data cleaning & preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest
- Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall

## Results
- Best model: Random Forest (~85% accuracy)
- Key insight: [short insight from analysis]

## Visualization
See `results/` folder for presentation slides and plots.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repo
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Open notebook: `crime_prediction.ipynb`
